# Thought Process

- two pointer squeeze
- sort the array
- iterate through the array
  - if the current element is greater than 0, break
    - because a negative number is needed to make the sum 0
  - if the current element is the same as the previous element, skip
  - set left pointer to i + 1
  - set right pointer to the end of the array
  - create a var target, i played around with negatives
    - target = -nums[i]
  - while left < right
    - if the sum of nums[left] + nums[right] is equal to target
      - add the triplet to the result
      - while left < right and nums[left] is the same as the next element
        - move the left pointer
      - while left < right and nums[right] is the same as the previous element
        - move the right pointer
      - move left and right pointers
    - if the sum is less than the target
      - move the left pointer
    - if the sum is greater than the target
      - move the right pointer
